# knee-finder

<h3>Usage</h3> 

---
<h3>Try it Yourself</h3> 
You can play with KneeFinder using the interactive Streamlit app available [here](https://rg1990-knee-finder-streamlit-knee-finder-mwgskp.streamlit.app/). You can see the results using example data from Severson et al. [2], a fake sigmoidal degradation curve, or you can upload your own data in CSV format.

<h3>Acknolwedgements & References</h3>
The application of Bacon-Watts and double Bacon-Watts to locate the knee point and onset was first described by Fermín-Cueto et al [1].<br><br>

The data used in this repo and in the associated Streamlit app is taken from [2].<br>

The method was extended by me (Richard Gilchrist), Calum Strange, Shawn Li and Goncalo dos Reis, as described in Strange et al. [3]. KneeFinder implementation by Richard Gilchrist.
